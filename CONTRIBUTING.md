## Style Guide

### TypeScript Style Guide

* Use TypeScript for all new code
* Follow the existing code style
* Use meaningful variable names
* Add types to all function parameters and return values
* Avoid `any` types

### Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
